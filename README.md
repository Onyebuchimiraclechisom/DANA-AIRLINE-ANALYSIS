## INTRODUCTION: 
For this Project Analysis, I will be stepping into the role of a Data Analyst at Dano Airlines, a United Kingdom-based airline with its headquarters in London. The most recent outcomes from the passenger survey indicate a notable decline in satisfaction, falling below 50% for the first time in the airline's history. In response to this urgent situation, the leadership team is seeking prompt action, and my task is to examine the data to identify the critical areas that require attention to facilitate a swift recovery.

**_Disclaimer_**: _The dataset and reports presented here are purely hypothetical and do not represent any specific company or institution. They serve as a demonstration of Power BI capabilities using a dummy dataset._
## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Devise a strategy backed by data to enhance the satisfaction rate of Dano Airlines.

## POWER BI SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:
- Data cleaning
- Tooltips
- Quick Measures
- Dax
- Conditional columns

## DATA SOURCING
This dataset was provided by Digitaley Drive as my project as a scholarship student.

## DATA TRANSFORMATION 
The data underwent thorough cleaning and transformation utilizing the Power Query Editor within Power BI. Noteworthy steps applied during this process include:

- Data cleaning: involved tasks such as eliminating duplicates, rectifying data types, and addressing any instances of excess spacing.
- Creating Conditional Columns 

## DATA MODELLING: 
No data model was implemented as there is only a single table or sheet present.

## ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:

In creating this visualization, I utilized multiple canvases. After conducting a comprehensive analysis, I discovered significant insights: the average age of customers is 39 years, and there are four distinct classesâ€”business class, economy class, and economy plus.


## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: 

  Male Satisfaction           |      Female Satisfaction
